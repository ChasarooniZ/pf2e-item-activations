### Notes and Limitations
#### Notes
- This module will exist until this feature is implemented into the core system
- Module will Mostly be kind of jank, and updated sporadically as I get time and motivation
#### Limitations
- Currently no Custom Activations (will most likely be a later feature)
- Activations in actors aren't updated unless you remove them and get them readded
- Activations only appear when an item is added/updated
- Activations currently don't have their own action category, I may look into that to see how difficult it would be
- Activations don't automatically update their uses you need to use the **PF2e Item Actions Module** to have that work
- Activations aren't disable when a player can't use them they just put an [X] in front of them## Features
Adds and removes actions from your inventory when you equip item etc.. Do note, you are unable to save the state of items at the moment, I may refactor in the future to have it show you items in your inventory that aren't equipped etc, but that's a later me problem

## FAQ
**Q: Will you add support for \<Insert System Here\>?**

A: This module will only support the **PF2e** system

**Q: Will you support Pre Remaster versions of items?**

A: Don't plan on it, when I add homebrew support someone else can add support for them though!
